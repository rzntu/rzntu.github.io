The module will investigate the integration of business know-how and advanced analytics technologies, such as machine learning and AI. Students are advised to look into content detail for specific offering during the year.\nIn this offering, we impart the techniques of web mining to students who are interested in understanding ways of retrieving valuable information from the web and various social media. It aims to teach students various concepts, methods and tools in mining Web data in the form of unstructured Web hyperlinks, page contents, and usage logs to uncover deep business insights and knowledge for business implications that are embedded in the billions of Web pages and servers. The focus of this course will be on text mining, where we look at mainly unstructured text. Methods of delivery of lessons include lectures and case study discussions. This course is delivered using Python.\nKey takeaways:  Understand the challenges of textual data collection and analysis; Describe basic concepts and methods used in text mining (E.g., vector representation of documents, feature extraction, text classification and clustering etc.); Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced text mining algorithms for tasks like text classification, clustering, opinion mining, and their applications in the real-world; Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications; Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusions.
