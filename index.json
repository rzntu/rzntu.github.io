In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring.

Sequential data modeling based on recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants have drawn increasing attention because the temporal nature of motor signals can be well leveraged for motor analysis. One common drawback of prior research is that signals measured on motors are typically analyzed with a fixed time window, making it difficult to trade off between global state estimation and local feature extraction. This paper presents a deep learning-based model termed Multi-Resolution \u0026 multi-Sensor Fusion Network (MRSFN) for motor fault diagnosis, through multi-scale analysis of motor vibration and stator current signals. Specifically, vibration and current signals are first segmented by analysis windows of varying lengths to create a new data stream for the joint representation and temporal encoding of the original sensor signals, based on two network structures: convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The advantage of the developed method is that it automatically learns the discriminative features through the network training process, without requiring manual feature selection as is typically the case in prior methods. By considering the temporal dependence of the signals being analyzed, the developed multi-resolution fusion technique not only improves the effectiveness of feature extraction but is also adaptive to varying motor speed. Two case studies demonstrate the advantages of the developed method.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-level information fusion for induction motor fault diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenghua Chen","Rui Zhao","Qingchang Zhu","Mustafa K Masood","Yeng Chai Soh","Kezhi Mao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"b9fcccbf0ecf5f567aa4b50e1338aa75","permalink":"https://rzntu.github.io/publication/chen-2017-building/","publishdate":"2019-10-03T09:00:43.159552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2017-building/","section":"publication","summary":"Buildings consume quite a lot of energy; hence, the issue of building energy efficiency has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. A key factor in achieving this objective is occupancy information that directly impacts on energy-related building control systems. In this paper, we leverage on environmental sensors that are nonintrusive and cost-effective for building occupancy estimation. Our result relies on feature engineering and learning. The conventional feature engineering requires one to manually extract relevant features without a clear guideline. This blind feature extraction is labor intensive and may miss some significant implicit features. To address this issue, we propose a convolutional deep bidirectional long short-term memory (CDBLSTM) approach that contains a convolutional network and a deep structure to automatically learn significant features from the sensory data without human intervention. Moreover, the long short-term memory networks are able to capture temporal dependencies in the data and the bidirectional structure can take the past and future contexts into consideration for the final identification of occupancy. We have conducted real experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed CDBLSTM approach. Instead of estimating the exact number of occupants, we attempt to identify the range of occupants, i.e., zero, low, medium, and high, which is adequate for most of building control systems. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","tags":null,"title":"Building occupancy estimation with environmental sensors via CDBLSTM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenjun Sun","Rui Zhao","Ruqiang Yan","Siyu Shao","Xuefeng Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"92e275be3c0bd2a7a4bfdedfb2813b55","permalink":"https://rzntu.github.io/publication/sun-2017-convolutional/","publishdate":"2019-10-03T09:00:43.147558Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2017-convolutional/","section":"publication","summary":"A convolutional discriminative feature learning method is presented for induction motor fault diagnosis.

One classical model is the Bag-of-Words (BoW). In a BoW-based vector representation of a document, each element denotes the normalized number of occurrence of a basis term in the document. To count the number of occurrence of a basis term, BoW conducts exact word matching, which can be regarded as a hard mapping from words to the basis term. BoW representation suffers from its intrinsic extreme sparsity, high dimensionality, and inability to capture high-level semantic meanings behind text data. To address the above issues, we propose a new document representation method named Fuzzy Bag-of-Words (FBoW) in this paper. FBoW adopts a fuzzy mapping based on semantic correlation among words quantified by cosine similarity measures between word embeddings. Since word semantic matching instead of exact word string matching is used, the FBoW could encode more semantics into the numerical representation. In addition, we propose to use word clusters instead of individual words as basis terms and develop Fuzzy Bag-of-WordClusters (FBoWC) models. Three variants under the framework of FBoWC are proposed based on three different similarity measures between word clusters and words, which are named as FBoWCmean, FBoWCmax and FBoWCmin, respectively. Document representations learned by the proposed FBoW and FBoWC are dense and able to encode high-level semantics. The task of document categorization is used to evaluate the performance of learned representation by the proposed FBoW and FBoWC methods. The results on seven real word document classification datasets in comparison with six document representation learning methods have shown that our methods FBoW and FBoWC achieve the highest classification accuracies.","tags":null,"title":"Fuzzy bag-of-words model for document representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rui Zhao","Dongzhe Wang","Ruqiang Yan","Kezhi Mao","Fei Shen","Jinjiang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3c2c76b2d55bf4ee728ce4641a1366e2","permalink":"https://rzntu.github.io/publication/zhao-2017-machine/","publishdate":"2019-10-03T09:00:43.164552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhao-2017-machine/","section":"publication","summary":"In modern industries, machine health monitoring systems (MHMS) have been applied wildly with the goal of realizing predictive maintenance including failures tracking, downtime reduction and assets preservation. In the era of big machinery data, data-driven MHMS have achieved remarkable results in the detection of faults after the occurrence of certain failures (diagnosis) and prediction of the future working conditions and the remaining useful life (prognosis). The numerical representation for raw sensory data is the key stone for various successful MHMS. Conventional methods are labor-extensive as they usually depend on handcrafted features, which require expert knowledge. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods that redefine representation learning from raw data, we propose local feature-based gated recurrent unit networks (LFGRU). It is a hybrid approach that combines handcrafted feature design with automatic feature learning for machine health monitoring. Firstly, features from windows of input time series are extracted. Then, an enhanced bi-directional GRU network is designed and applied on the generated sequence of local features to learn the representation. A supervised learning layer is finally trained to predict machine condition. Experiments on three machine health monitoring tasks: tool wear prediction, gearbox fault diagnosis and incipient bearing fault detection verify the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed LFGRU.","tags":null,"title":"Machine health monitoring using local feature-based gated recurrent unit networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinjiang Wang","Junyao Xie","Rui Zhao","Kezhi Mao","Laibin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"285ea265ebc05d69be19e34a9511bd9a","permalink":"https://rzntu.github.io/publication/wang-2016-new/","publishdate":"2019-10-03T09:00:43.135564Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2016-new/","section":"publication","summary":"The features extracted from multisensory measurements can be used to characterize machinery conditions.

First, the mathematical structure of the PKFA is formulated incorporating kernel techniques on the basis of conventional factor analysis (FA). Next, a PKFA-based machining tool condition monitoring model with support vector regression is presented. The effectiveness of the scheme is experimentally verified on a machining tool testbed.

These models normally train various forms of neural networks on top of pre-trained word embeddings using a taskspecific corpus. However, most of these works neglect the multisense nature of words in the pre-trained word embeddings. In this paper we introduce topic models to enrich the word embeddings for multi-senses of words. The integration of the topic model with various semantic compositional processes leads to Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Network (TopCNN) and Topic-Aware Long Short Term Memory Networks (TopLSTMs). Different from previous multi-sense word embeddings models that assign multiple independent and sense-specific embeddings to each word, our proposed models are lightweight and flexible frameworks that regard word sense as the composition of two parts: a general sense derived from a large corpus and a topicspecific sense derived from a task-specific corpus. In addition, our proposed models focus on semantic composition instead of word understanding. With the help of topic models, we can integrate the topic-specific sense at word-level before composition and sentence-level after composition. Comprehensive experiments on five public sentence classification datasets are conducted, and the results show that our proposed Topic-Aware deep compositional models produce competitive or better performance than other text representation learning methods.","tags":null,"title":"Topic-aware deep compositional models for sentence classification","type":"publication"}]
